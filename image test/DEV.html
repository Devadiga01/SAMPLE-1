	<p>Hello everyone,The main intention to design this HTML page is to learn about it. Baically i am learning very few i want explore more, </p>
	<p>This is the right time to do such things during Pandamic.My go-to online dictionary describes an entrepreneur as “a person who starts a business and is willing to risk loss in order to make money” or “one who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise.” Note the common keywords business and risk</p>
	<p>An entrepreneur is an individual who creates a new business, bearing most of the risks and enjoying most of the rewards. The entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator, a source of new ideas, goods, services, and business/or procedures.</p>
